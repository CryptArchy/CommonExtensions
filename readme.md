# Common Extensions

This is an old project from years ago that probably doesn't work anymore, but I'm uploading it for posterity. The code is based on several sources, this was just my set of utility classes and extension methods for use in personal projects.

I make no ownership claims except for the code that I actually wrote. There's probably a few snippets here and there copy-pasted from others without attribution, but this was all just for learning purposes, nothing commercially releasable here.
